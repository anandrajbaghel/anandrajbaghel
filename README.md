## 🌟 Featured Project - Building in the Real World 🤖

[**Robotic Arm**](https://github.com/anandrajbaghel/Robotic-Arm) - More than just code, this project involved the entire process: from concept to construction, to programming the arm to lift and displace 100g weights. It was a challenging, but incredibly fulfilling project. It shows my passion for both hardware and software integration.

(I'm always open to suggestions on improvements!)
